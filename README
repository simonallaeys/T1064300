Features related to integrating 3rd party services 
===
If you are implementing a 4 credits course versions, you should select any two from the following list of features. If you are implementing a 5 credits versions, you should select at least three (3).

- Use our payment service to pay orders before accepting them (http://webcourse.cs.hut.fi/payment/). You don't need to implement ordering UI, if you don't implement this feature.

- Allow users to easily post a link to a photo album to Twitter, Google+, or similar service. For private albums, generate a public link that can be used to link to your album when sharing online (with friends, for example).

- Use the Flickr API or some other image service API to allow users to search images when adding images to pages.

- Allow OpenID, Gmail or Facebook login to your system. Before implementing, think what information you get from third party login services and if some extra information is also needed. This is the only feature where you are allowed to use third party apps into your service.
